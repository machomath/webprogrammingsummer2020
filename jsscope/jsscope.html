    <h1>Knowing JS Scope</h1>
    There are 3 ways to declair variables in JS
    <ol>
      <li>var
        <ul>
          <li>var has a global scope if it is not declair in a function</li>
          <li>if a var is declair in a function its scope is inside the function</li>
          <li>Note that it is differnt from C where a variable has block scope</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>let
        <ul>
          <li>let has block scope</li>
          <li>if not in a block it is again global</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>const (In JS const is little different)
        <ul>
          <li>const is like the const of C but totally different</li>
          <li>Scope wise const is like let</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
