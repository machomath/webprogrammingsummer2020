        <i>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not
        simply random text.</i> It has roots in a piece of
        classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
        over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
        professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
        looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
        consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
        and going through the cites of the word in
        classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
        source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32
        and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
        (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written
        in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
        ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. <em>The
        first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
        amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</em>
